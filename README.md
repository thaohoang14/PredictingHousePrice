This project aims to improve the performance of deep learning models through systematic experimentation. Different data preprocessing and augmentation techniques, as well as alternative model architectures, will be tested to identify configurations that yield the best results. Each model type will undergo at least ten experiments to explore the effects of these variations. The best-performing models—based on predefined evaluation metrics—will then be analyzed to interpret their results and derive recommendations for future model development.
